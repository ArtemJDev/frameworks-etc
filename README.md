# Frameworks-etc. ( work has been stopped)
Hello!
This is a complex repository, my practice, all attempts to parse technologies, incomprehensible things and discoveries to me, everything is here.  
All this is more for personal use than for general, there are few comments and a not very clear structure, but I will try to explain to you.  

    Now all the projects have been moved to another repository (Final projects), there are only some files left that sometimes help me not to forget the basics and practice

## Structure
* Hibernate  
(early beginnings and training work with this framework, just files for practice)
* Spring  
(mastering technology and several project attempts, also just practice)
* Web  
(mastering technology and several project attempts, also just practice)
* XML  
(analysis of work with documents XML)

## What next
At the moment, work in this repository has been stopped and all projects are created, for convenience, in separate repositories, which are then summed up in the repository - **Final Projects**.
